Wipro Limited, headquartered in Bangalore, India, was founded on December 29, 1945, by MH Hasham Premji as Western India Vegetable Products Limited. Over time, the company transitioned from its original business of vegetable oil manufacturing to become a global leader in IT services and consulting. Today, Wipro operates in over 60 countries and provides a wide range of services including software development, system integration, IT consulting, business process outsourcing, cloud services, engineering, and consulting across industries such as financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and telecommunications. With a workforce of over 234,000 employees as of March 2024, 36.6% of whom are women, Wipro remains one of India’s largest IT companies.

Financially, Wipro reported revenues of approximately ₹92,972 crore (around US$11 billion) for the fiscal year ending March 2025, with an operating income of ₹17,495 crore and net profit of ₹13,218 crore. The company is publicly traded on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with the promoter group, headed by Azim Premji, holding a controlling stake of nearly 73% as of March 2024.

Historically, Wipro’s shift to IT began in the 1980s with the establishment of subsidiaries focused on computer hardware and software. Notably, in 1981, the company developed the first Indian computer based on a microchip. During the 1990s, it expanded aggressively into software services, becoming the second-largest Indian software exporter by 1998. The 2000s marked further growth with multiple acquisitions in technology, consulting, cybersecurity, and cloud services across the US, Europe, and Australia, including some deals valued at over a billion dollars. In 2011, in partnership with ISRO, Wipro developed India’s then-fastest supercomputer. In 2012, Wipro spun off its non-IT businesses such as consumer care and lighting into a separate entity to focus on its core technology services.

Wipro’s leadership has evolved over the decades, with several CEOs steering the company through its growth phases. The current CEO, Srini Pallia, took charge in 2024. Despite its successes, the company faced criticism in 2023 for reducing the annual salary packages of new hires by 50%, affecting around 4,000 employees, a decision that was met with resistance from employee unions but was defended by Wipro as necessary due to changing business conditions.

Overall, Wipro remains a prominent player in the global IT services industry, leveraging a diverse portfolio of services and a broad international presence to maintain its competitive position.

Wipro Limited is a leading Indian IT services company, publicly listed and actively traded on stock exchanges. Its financial data over recent years reflect substantial growth and operational scale. From 2021 to 2025, Wipro’s revenue increased significantly from ₹278,115 crore in 2021 to ₹490,937 crore in 2025, highlighting strong top-line expansion. Correspondingly, the net profit surged from ₹24,317 crore to ₹79,017 crore over the same period, demonstrating healthy bottom-line growth. Earnings per share (EPS) showed a consistent upward trajectory, growing from 25.11 in 2021 to 86.91 in 2025, reflecting improved profitability and value delivered to shareholders. The company’s book value per share (BVPS) increased from ₹282.35 in 2021 to ₹545.72 in 2025, indicating a growing net asset base and shareholder equity. Return on equity (ROE), a key measure of profitability relative to shareholder equity, rose from 8.89% in 2021 to a peak of 17.31% in 2024 before a slight decrease to 15.92% in 2025, showing sustained efficiency in generating returns. Net interest margin (NIM), though more relevant for financial institutions, is reported around 2.5–2.7%, which is stable over the years.

On the market performance and technical side, Wipro’s stock shows key pivot levels calculated based on the previous trading days and weeks, with support and resistance levels outlined by classic, Fibonacci, and Camarilla methods. Recent chart patterns identified include bullish reversal signals such as the Falling Channel Breakout, Bullish Flag continuation, Bullish Harmonic patterns like AB=CD and Bat, as well as Ascending Triangle consolidation breakouts. These technical indicators suggest positive momentum and potential upward price movements in short to medium terms. However, despite these promising technical signals, the company’s stock price has experienced some volatility, with peer comparisons showing mixed one-year performance returns and price-to-earnings (PE) ratios indicating relative valuation levels within the sector.

The ownership structure of Wipro is marked by a significant promoter holding of approximately 56.92%, with foreign institutional investors (FII), domestic institutional investors (DII), public shareholders, and others accounting for the remaining shares. The trend in shareholding and pledges has been tracked quarterly, reflecting market confidence and promoter commitments.

Investor sentiments gathered from forum discussions on Moneycontrol reveal mixed opinions, with some concerns raised over turnover figures and market triggers, while others question the company's strategic directions. Despite these, Wipro continues to maintain its status as a major player in India’s IT industry with robust financial performance, supported by increasing revenues, profits, and shareholder returns, alongside positive technical market indicators. The advisory notes caution investors to be wary of fraudulent solicitations claiming assured returns, underscoring the importance of relying on verified sources for investment decisions.
